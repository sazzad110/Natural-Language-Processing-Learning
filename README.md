# NLP Learning Resources ðŸ“š

Welcome to my NLP (Natural Language Processing) learning repository! This repo is a personal collection of resources, code, and notes I've compiled while studying NLP, covering topics from basic text preprocessing to advanced deep learning models. It's designed to serve as a roadmap and knowledge base that I can refer to and build upon as I deepen my understanding of NLP.

## Introduction

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that bridges the gap between human language and computer understanding. My goal with this repository is to gather all essential knowledge and resources in a structured format, making it easier to track my progress, share my journey, and reference useful materials as I continue to grow in this field.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders based on the stages of NLP learning, each containing notebooks, code, and resources relevant to that topic.

- **Basics/**: Foundational NLP concepts and techniques, such as tokenization and part-of-speech tagging.
- **Text_Preprocessing/**: Resources and code on cleaning, lemmatization, stemming, and more.
- **Vectorization/**: Techniques like Bag of Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and embeddings.
- **Deep_Learning/**: Advanced NLP with RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.
- **Projects/**: End-to-end projects to apply NLP knowledge in real-world scenarios.

## Topics Covered

This repository is structured to progress from foundational concepts to advanced NLP models, including:

1. **Basics**: Tokenization, POS tagging, stopword removal.
2. **Text Preprocessing**: Techniques to prepare raw text data for modeling.
3. **Vectorization**: Converting text data to numerical formats for machine learning.
4. **Deep Learning**: Understanding neural networks and applying RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers to NLP tasks.
5. **Real-world Projects**: Applying what Iâ€™ve learned to build useful NLP applications.

## How to Use This Repository

This repository is a work-in-progress as I explore and learn more about NLP. Each folder contains topic-specific notebooks and resources. Feel free to browse through the notebooks and scripts, and refer to the **Progress.md** file to see a log of daily progress and insights.

## Resources and References


Please refer to each topicâ€™s README for more specific resources.

## Progress Tracking

Daily learning and progress will be documented in the **Progress.md** file, noting down key insights, challenges, and future topics to explore.

## Contributions

This is a personal project for learning, but contributions are always welcome. If you have any resource suggestions or improvements, feel free to create a pull request or open an issue.

Happy learning! ðŸŽ‰
